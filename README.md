The project is currently online at this URL: https://linktr.ee/re4lvansh

#### About My Model
The "Codeforces to Codechef and Codechef to Codeforces Rating Converter" project aims to provide a reliable and user-friendly solution for converting ratings between Codeforces and Codechef, two prominent competitive programming platforms. By utilizing polynomial regression, along with popular Python libraries such as scikit-learn, matplotlib, mpld3, and NumPy, this project effectively addresses the challenge of rating conversion.

#### Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to develop an accurate rating conversion model by leveraging polynomial regression. The conversion process involves establishing a mathematical relationship between Codeforces and Codechef ratings, taking into account the skewed data representation between higher ratings. Polynomial regression offers the advantage of capturing the non-linear correlations present in the data while avoiding the overfitting issues associated with higher-dimensional models.

#### Key Components
**Polynomial Regression:** Polynomial regression serves as the core algorithm in this project. It is chosen due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships between Codeforces and Codechef ratings. By fitting a polynomial function to the training data, the regression model can effectively estimate the conversion between the two rating scales.

**scikit-learn:** The scikit-learn library, a widely-used machine learning toolkit in Python, is employed to implement the polynomial regression model. It provides an extensive set of tools for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction, simplifying the overall development process.

**matplotlib:** To visualize the relationship between Codeforces and Codechef ratings and provide interactive graphs, matplotlib is utilized. This powerful plotting library enables the creation of informative visualizations that aid in understanding the rating conversion process. Users can gain insights into the conversion formula and observe the trends and patterns between the two platforms.

**mpld3:** The mpld3 library is employed to seamlessly integrate the interactive matplotlib graphs into web frameworks. It enables the conversion of matplotlib plots to HTML and JavaScript, facilitating the embedding of interactive graphs into web pages. This integration enhances the user experience by allowing users to interact with the rating conversion tool directly from their browsers.

**NumPy:** NumPy, a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python, plays a crucial role in this project. It provides efficient data processing capabilities, including array operations and transformations. NumPy's array structures are employed for storing and manipulating the rating data, enabling seamless integration with scikit-learn and other components of the project.

#### Conclusion
The "Codeforces to Codechef and Codechef to Codeforces Rating Converter" project demonstrates the effectiveness of polynomial regression in accurately converting ratings between Codeforces and Codechef platforms. By incorporating scikit-learn, matplotlib, mpld3, and NumPy, the project offers an intuitive and efficient solution for competitive programmers seeking to translate their ratings between these two popular platforms.

The implementation of polynomial regression addresses the non-linear relationship between the rating scales, ensuring reliable and precise rating conversions. The interactive visualizations provided by matplotlib and mpld3 enhance the user experience, enabling users to explore and understand the rating conversion process in a more intuitive and engaging manner.

With its user-friendly interface and accurate rating conversion capabilities, this project empowers competitive programmers to compare their rankings, track their progress, and participate in contests across multiple platforms more effectively. It highlights the potential of polynomial regression and related libraries in solving real-world problems in the field of competitive programming.
